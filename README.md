### 许可证

rc522 package 遵循 Apache license v2.0 许可，详见 `LICENSE` 文件。

### 依赖

- RT-Thread 3.0+
- RT-Thread 4.0+

## 如何打开 rc522

使用 hello package 需要在 RT-Thread 的包管理器中选择它，具体路径如下：

```
RT-Thread online packages
    peripheral libraries and drivers --->
        [*] rc522: rfid module driver
```

开启了软件包之后，一般还需要配置使用的 SPI 口和使用的 RST 与 INT 管脚

然后让 RT-Thread 的包管理器自动更新，或者使用 pkgs --update 命令更新包到 BSP 中。

## 示例运行
